CHANGELOG:

(Version 9.2.2) - Thanks to some code from gfgtdf I have implemented a lua advancement solution that replaces the old advancements. Now you don't need the other RoTL add-on but instead only click to turn on or off the advancement modification and allow your units to advance to lvl 4 and 5 heroes!

Also a new rogue archer line has been added with the Altawir and the Muhtal who advance from the Muharib.
Also all level 2 unit's prices (in the Reign of Heroes) have been balanced. A considerable undertaking, but now it should be a good deal more balanced!
